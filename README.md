üéûÔ∏è heycinema isa search app from the OMDb API RESTful web service to obtain movie pieces of information, with All Best Practices.

### Tech

heycinema uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [React] - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [MUI] - A lightweight CSS framework 
* [Webpack] - Bundle assets scripts
* [Eslint] - Pluggable JavaScript linter
* [Babel] - The compiler for writing next generation JavaScript

And of course heycinema itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

Install the dependencies and devDependencies.

```sh
$ cd to heycinema
$ yarn

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Test

```sh

```sh
yarn jest --watch
```
